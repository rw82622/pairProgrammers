This is a python program to help my Code Platoon Instructors quickly generate a random list
of pair programming partners.

Input:
The program loads a list of dictionaries containing each students name from the data.json file

Output:
The program outputs a list of random names in pairs.
#Note: The last pairing will consist of 3 names if there's an odd number of total students.
